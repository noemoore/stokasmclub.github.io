   <div id="essay"><p>THE ACT OF ENGAGING WITH A WORK OF ART IS INHERENTLY DISSOCIATIVE. THE BODY AND ITS CONTEXT ARE ABANDONED IN AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE INSTANTANEOUS SUFFERING (I.S.) AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CAPACITY TO COMBAT OR, IN MANY CASES, EVEN APPREHEND DURATIONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SUFFERING (D.I.S.). CLAIMS OF THE ABILITY OF ART TO MATERIALLY TRANSFIGURE ONE'S CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ABUNDANT. WHAT WE OBSERVE IN INDIVIDUAL CASES, HOWEVER, ARE BRIEF DURATIONS OF 'MOOD IMPROVEMENT' UNTIL SOURCES OF D.I.S. MANIFEST IN CONSCIOUS FOCUS AS I.S. </p><p>BASED ON THE ULTIMATE FAILURE OF THIS BRIEF SELF-DECEPTION, WE COULD GENEROUSLY CHARACTERIZE THIS EFFECT OF ENGAGING WITH A WORK OF ART AS NOTHING MORE THAN PLACEBIC. BUT UPON CLOSER INSPECTION, THE SEROTONERGIC AND DOPAMINERGIC RESPONSES OF THE INDIVIDUAL MORE CLOSELY MIMIC THE CYCLES ASSOCIATED WITH 'SUBSTANCES.' OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 'CONTENT' IS THEN PERHAPS BEST SEEN AS AKIN WITH THE KIND OF DELETERIOUS, CONSUMING SPIRAL OF A BENDER, WITH THE SAME LOGIC OF DESPERATION, VIZ. 'IF I JUST HAD ONE MORE, I WILL BE HEALED...'</p><p>A LONE INDIVIDUAL ENGAGED IN THIS SPIRAL HAS A RADIUS OF IMPACT IS RESTRICTED TO THE MICROSOCIAL, BUT AN ENTIRE CIVILIZATION RETREATING TO SIMULATED EMOTIONAL SPACES, ASSIMILATING INTO THEMSELVES UNTESTED LOGICS AND KNOWLEDGES FROM SOURCES OF UNKNOWN INTENT, ORIGIN, AND QUALIFICATION (E.G. 'AUTHORS,' 'ARTISTS'), WHICH THEY THEN FURTHER MODIFY, CORRUPT AND WITLESSLY FLING LIKE GOSSAMER THREADS OF SILK INTO THE EXPANSE OF CULTURE, ENSNARING OTHER AGENTS, PERVERTING AND CONVOLUTING, WHO THEN PROCESS AND FLING AGAIN INTO THE BLACK, AD INFINITUM, IS WHAT POSES THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR CONTINUED SURVIVAL, OUR HEALING, OUR RECOVERY.</p><p>IT SEEMS OBVIOUS, THEN, THAT 'CULTURE MATTER' WHICH ALLOWS US THIS FORM OF RETREAT INTO IMAGINATION, WHICH HERETOFOR HAS BEEN POPULARLY CHARACTERIZED AS A SPIRITUALLY NOURISHING PRACTICE, IS ACTUALLY THE BLINDFOLD WHICH AFFORDS THE CONTINUANCE OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF D.I.S. </p><p>IN ORDER TO CONFRONT THE SOURCES OF D.I.S. IT SEEMS TO FOLLOW THAT WE MUST COLLECTIVELY TURN AWAY FROM THE SEDUCTION OF THE STAGING GROUNDS OF NARRATIVE, AWAY FROM THE THE COMFORTS OF SIMULATION, SO THAT WE CAN FINALLY FACE AND EXAMINE THE ORIGIN OF THE RADIATION OF SUFFERING AND ELIMINATE IT IN TOTO.</p><p>HOWEVER, THE ACT OF TURNING AWAY EN MASSE IS BOTH IMPOSSIBLY DIFFICULT AND HISTRIONIC. THE MODES OF CONSUMPTION AND THE 'CONTENT' THEY DELIVER HAVE BEEN EXPRESSLY DESIGNED IN TANDEM WITH BEHAVIOURAL PSYCHOLOGY AND OPTIMIZED TO ENSURE A SORT OF IRRESISTABILITY. EVEN UNDER THE OPTIMISTIC BELIEF THAT THE COLLECTIVE HUMAN WILL OF CIVILIZATION CAN SLAM THE BREAKS AND REVERSE, THE MODES OF CONSUMPTION HAVE BECOME SO DEEPLY ENMESHED IN THE 'NECESSARY ACTS' OF 'EXISTING' IN 'SOCIETY' THAT A RECUSAL IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT RENDERING ONESELF A PHANTOM, NONCORPEREAL AND POWERLESS AS IN DEATH BUT WITH THE PERCEPTUAL CAPACITY TO WITNESS THE SYSTEMS OF D.I.S. CAREEN ONWARD WITH NO DRIVER, THE EYES OF PASSENGERS DIM, DOWNWARD, ENTIRELY UNAFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF A SOLE AGENT BECAUSE ABANDONING MODES OF CONSUMPTION MEANS ABANDONING AVENUES TO APPEAR IN ANOTHER'S VISION. ATTEMPTS TO RECUSE ONESELF ARE STRICTLY SYMBOLIC GESTURES, SENSELESS AND SELF-CENTERED IN THAT THE GESTURE CANNOT BE OBSERVED BY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THESE SYSTEMS IT IS ATTEMPING TO REJECT, LEAVING THE RECUSED, ALONE AND SELF-SATISFIED, AS THE SOLE WITNESS AND BENEFICIARY OF THE ACT, ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING.</p><p>THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE A PRAXIS FOR UPENDING, DISMANTLING, OR OTHERWISE SUBVERTING CONTEMPORARY MODES OF CONTENT DISSEMINATION AND CONSUMPTION IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR CONTINUED SURVIVAL. IT IS RELEVANT, THEN, TO BRIEFLY EXAMINE THE PRACTICE OF CULTURE-MAKING W/R/T ART TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN BE EXPLOITED.</p><p>CULTURAL ARTIFACTS EMPLOY A 'LOSSY CODEC' IN THE COMPRESSION OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE. THE ADDITION OF 'NOISE' ON THE LEVEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS PART OF WHY 'CONTENT' PROLIFERATES TO ITS CONTEMPORARY DEGREE: AN AGENT CARRIES WITH THEM SOME SET OF SOCIALIZED VALUES, PREFERENCES, ETC., WHICH DIFFER TO VARIOUS EXTENTS FROM NEIGHBORING AGENTS. THESE DIFFERENCES SERVE AS THE WARPED FILTER THROUGH WHICH EXPERIENCE IS FILTERED, INTERPRETED, AND SUBSEQUENTLY RE-RENDERED, SIMULATED. WHEN A CULTURAL ARTIFACT IS CONSTRUCTED BY AN AGENT, IT EXISTS AS A UNIQUE - THOUGH INFREQUENTLY NOVEL - ITERATION ON A SET OF DATA WHICH CHANGES SHAPE BASED ON CONTEXT. THE GENERATION OF ARTIFACT-AS-AGGREGATE SPIRALS ENDLESSLY AS LONG AS THERE EXISTS THE VARIANCE OF THAT WHICH 'SHAPES' AND 'FEEDS' THE AGENT OF CULTURE. </p><p>THIS COLLECTIVE AIMS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOSSY COMPRESSION OF ART TO EVENTUALLY RENDER ITS CONTENTS TOTALLY ASEMIC, A TANGLED NEST OF BROKEN REFERENCES, BY HIJACKING AND INVOLUTING THE VERY TACTICS WHICH UNTIL NOW HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROLIFERATION, BY FACING THE MIRROR TO ITSELF.</p><p>THE TACTICS OF 'INVOLUTION' HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET IN MOTION BY ENTERPRISING ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS ATTEMPTING TO ENGINEER CULTURAL ARTIFACTS WHICH TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SYNTACTIC SHORTCUTS IN ORDER TO MAKE $$$. THE ARTIFACTS CHARACTERIZED AS 'LOWER-BROW' ARE TYPICALLY IDENTIFIED AS POP SONGS, SITCOMS, BLOCKBUSTERS, ETC., WHICH EMPLOY 'FORMULAE' TO GAIN EASY ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL READERS ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL. THE 'HIGHER-BROW' ARE IDENTIFIED AS (SOME) CONCEPTUAL POETS, COLLAGISTS, ETC., I.E. ARTISTS WHICH EMPLOY THE TECHNIQUE CALLED 'APPROPRIATION.' THE REUSE OF 'CULTURE MATTER' CAN BE MINIMAL, AS IN 'INTERTEXT' AND 'ALLUSION,' BUT THE OUTRIGHT CRIBBING OF LARGE CHUNKS OF PREEXISTING SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC DATA, EITHER THRU APPROPRIATION OR THRU FORMULAE, IS VIOLENT IN THE SENSE THAT IT CORRUPTS OR EVEN DESTROYS THE AFFECTIVE AND HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS THE READINGS OF THE INITIAL TEXTS CARRY. THIS SET OF PRACTICES AND THE 'CONFUSION' IT CREATES OVERALL REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS AND MEANING OF 'CULTURE MATTER' BY CREATING A CHAIN OF REFERENCES WHICH IS SO INVOLUTED THAT THE INITIAL REFERENTS ARE INSCRUTABLE. CULTURE WHICH FEEDS ON ITSELF EVENTUALLY RENDERS ITSELF 'NUTRITIONLESS,' 'INEFFECTIVE.'</p><p>THIS COLLECTIVE INTENDS TO EMPLOY AND SPREAD THE TACTICS OF INVOLUTION, BROADLY, WITH THE ASPIRATIONS OF ENCOURAGING THE CREATION OF A 'SEMIOTIC SINGULARITY': AN EXTREMELY DENSE POINT-MASS OF CULTURE FROM WHICH NO MEANING CAN ESCAPE, SO THAT ART'S SEDATIVE QUALITIES ARE NONEXISTENT, RENDERING IT OBSOLETE, UNNECESSARY, BOTH AS A PRODUCER AND AS A CONSUMER, IN ORDER TO PUT HUMANKIND IN A POSITION TO FINALLY FACE HELL AND WALK BACKWARDS INTO GOD AND WORK TO ELIMINATE THE SOURCES OF D.I.S.</p><p>PERHAPS AN APPROPRIATE ANALOGY IS THE PHOTOCOPIER. IMAGINE A SHEET OF PRINTER PAPER WITH A BLACK AND WHITE REPRODUCTION OF A PAINTING ON IT. WE PLACE IT ON THE PHOTOCOPIER AND HIT THE GREEN BUTTON AND IT RETURNS A FACSIMILE THAT BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE ORIGINAL BUT WITH SPECKS OF BLACK WHERE THERE WEREN'T PREVIOUSLY AND WITH WHITES BLOWN OUT. WE THEN FEED THIS COPY BACK INTO THE COPIER, WHICH THEN RETURNS ANOTHER DISTORTION, MORE BLOWN OUT, NOISIER, ETC. WE REPEAT THIS PROCESS UNTIL THE PAGE THAT IS RETURNED IS MOSTLY WHITE, WITH VAGUE STROKES OF BLACK, NO FORM DISTINGUISHABLE, EMPTY OF MEANING, READY TO BE DISCARDED.</p><p>THE GOAL, REALLY, IS TO CAUSE ART TO 'FALL AWAY' FROM MEANING LIKE THE SHELL FROM THE MOLTING CICADA, THIN AND BRITTLE, PERFECT SOUND UNDER FOOT.</p>
